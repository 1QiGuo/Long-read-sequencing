# Long-read-sequencing
## History of Sequencing 
#### Third generation sequencing（Long read sequencing）
Single molecular seuqncing using nanopore technology. 
##### Feature
1.Do not need pcr, which avoid extra errors generated during pcr process.

2.Higer speed than next-generation sequencing.

3.Longer read(10k bp). Avoiding assembly error for next generation(50-400 bp)(10.1016/j.cmi.2017.10.013)

e.g. light signal: SMART microarray, Pacific Biosciences; electical signal: Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT)

## Application of long read seuencing on single-cell.
