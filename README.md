# Long-read-sequencing
## Introduction of third generation Sequencing 
Single molecular seuqncing.
Third generation sequencing(long read sequencing)
### Feature
#### Adventages:
1.Not need pcr, which avoid extra errors generated during pcr process.

2.Higer speed than next-generation sequencing.

3.Longer read(10k bp). Avoiding assembly error for next generation(50-400 bp)(10.1016/j.cmi.2017.10.013)
#### Disadventages:
1.Accuracy of per read can be much lower than short-read. This is because inability to control the speed of the DNA molecules through the pore.

#### Tools
e.g. light signal: SMART microarray, Pacific Biosciences; electical signal: Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT)

## Application of long read seuencing on single-cell
### Smart-Seq2
#### Disadvantages
1.It can only processed limited number of cells due to highly relied on plate or well-based microfluidics.10-100s
2.Cost per cell is high as it require amounts of reads to reconstrcuct paired antigen receptors.
3.Short reads makes it difficult or impossible to decipher critical alternative splicing of mRNA segments？？？

### RAGE-seq:targeted long read single cell sequencing
Single-cell sequencing only generates short read from one-end of a cDNA template. This short read sequencing can not capture complex gene rearrangement and alternative RNA-splicing.

For example, it can not trace the response of single cell of immune system during their response to cancer. Similarly, gene rearrangement and alternative RNA splicing also create pathological cell divisity amongst cancer cells.

#### Nature
Link full length targeted sequencing and short-read single cell.
